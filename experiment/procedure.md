• Do the connection as per the circuit diagram.


• Keep the knob at the zero position and switch on the power supply.


• Increase the variable voltage slowly until the fluorescent tube flickers and
glows. Measure the current, voltage and power.


• Take another 4 sets of ammeter, voltmeter, and wattmeter reading at
different positions of knob while the tube is glowing.


• Record the reading in observation table.


• Switch off the power supply.<br>

• After completing the simulation click on Table and graph button to draw garph between voltage / power and volatge/ current by making the variation from the drop down menu of voltage and power and variation in power factor by clicking on power factor button
