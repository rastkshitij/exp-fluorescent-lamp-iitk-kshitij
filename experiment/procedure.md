• Click on the "Enable Power" button.


• Click on Different component buttons to add in the circuit.


• After adding all the components click on connect button to complete the circuit.


• Note The different POwer consumption readings for different Wattmeter Multiplying Factor.


• After completing the simulation click on Table and graph button to draw garph between voltage / power and volatge/ current by making the variation from the drop down menu of voltage and power and variation in power factor by clicking on power factor button.
