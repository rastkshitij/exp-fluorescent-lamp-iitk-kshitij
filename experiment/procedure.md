• Click on the "Enable Power" button.

• Click on different component buttons to add components to the circuit.

• After adding all the components, click on the Connect button to complete the circuit.

• Note the different power consumption readings for different wattmeter multiplying factors.

• After completing the simulation, click on the Table and Graph button to draw graphs between voltage/power and voltage/current by selecting the variations from the drop-down menu for voltage and power, and adjust the power factor by clicking on the Power Factor button.
